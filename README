This is going to be a location for code used to create assignments for a class on the mathematical, physical, and electrical theory behind cardiology. It is an entrance into a secret sanctum.

I will use this as a place to store code created in html, MATLAB, or if I begin using it R, and hopefully python or C++

I may also do some basic Arduino stuff with this as well.

Please do not plaigarize any code or writings in this repository, it violates the Honor Code at the University I am currently attending.
I am not to be held responsible if you use this to cheat.

Thanks,

Ali
